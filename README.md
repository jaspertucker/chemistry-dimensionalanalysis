# chemistry-dimensionalanalysis
A small program to convert between units that I made for chemistry class.

This can currently convert between temperatures, area, speed, and length. Any not listed here will not work. Other units are also planned.

Syntax
Unit input is non case sensitive. Typing the abbreviation is also supported, with a slash replacing the 'p' representing the 'per' in speed measurements. Example: both 'Miles Per Hour' and 'm/h' work.
Units
  1. Temperature
  2. Area
  3. Speed
